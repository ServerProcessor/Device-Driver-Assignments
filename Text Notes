1- SMP (symmetric multiprocessing) is the processing of programs by multiple processors that share a common operating system and 
memory. In symmetric (or "tightly coupled") multiprocessing, the processors share memory and the I/O bus or data path.

2- In computing, the process identifier (normally referred to as the process ID or just PID) is a number used by most operating 
system kernels — such as that of UNIX, macOS or Microsoft Windows — to uniquely identify an active process.
